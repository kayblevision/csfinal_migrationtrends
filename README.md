# csfinal_migrationtrends

This project aims to predict refugee migration trends based on monthly data from 1951 to 2016. The Prophet and LSTM time series models are used to predict the number of asylum seekers entering the US, Canada, and Australia from 2017 to 2022. Charts and graphs are also created to visualize data and display underlying trends concurrent to historical events.
